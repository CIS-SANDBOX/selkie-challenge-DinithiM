Build a basic RESTful API setup with any language or framework of  your choosing.

Your API should accept HTTP GET requests at:

http://localhost:8090/api

The request should return a 200 OK status for the above base url.

Update the README.md with basic instructions on how to build and run the API. 

**Note**

If you are to use a database, it is recommended that you use an embedded database like H2, HSQL for ease of configuration, and quick startup times, though it is not mandatory to use an embedded database.

If your API is supposed to run on an application server such as Tomcat, it is recommended that you use an embedded server instead, to be able to package the entire application in a single executable file and to be able to start from a standard main method.
